DSLIST for batch is a batch program to create an output data set
with output similar to the output a TSO user can get using the
ISPF/PDF DSLIST function.

Use JCL like this to run DSLIST for batch.

//        EXEC PGM=DSLIST,PARM='data set selection pattern'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*

The data set selection pattern specifies a pattern identical to
the data set selection pattern a TSO/ISPF user can enter on the
Dsname level line in the Data Set List utility in ISPF/PDF.
However, you cannot specify wildcard text in the first index
level.

DSLIST opereates in task mode, problem state and problem key.  It
uses no APF restricted z/OS resource.  It does not attempt to
evade any z/OS security convention.

Debugging code is present in DSLIST; some of this code has been
commented to avoid littering the output with debugging
information.

CSIDUMP  Source for a program to run IGGCSI00 and dump its output.
         CSIDUMP will require a minor modifiction before it will
         run in most MVS installations.  This modification will
         be discussed later in this member.
DSLIST   The source for the DSLIST program
MINIFMT  Source for a message format program used by DSLIST.
OBJECT   Object decks from assembling DSLIST and MINIFMT, with
         Binder control statements to prepare the DSLIST load
         module.

You can prepare the DSLIST binary execuitable load module two ways.
- You can link the object member in this data set
- You can assemble and link the source members in this data set.

Use JCL like this to assemble and link DSLIST

//ASMCL   PROC
//C       EXEC PGM=ASMA90,
               PARM='OBJECT,NODECK,NOTHREAD,XREF(SHORT),BATCH'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=(MOD,PASS),DSN=&&OBJ,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1)),
//             DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3200)
//SYSLIB   DD  DISP=(SHR,PASS),DSN=SYS1.MODGEN
//         DD  DISP=(SHR,PASS),DSN=SYS1.MACLIB
//SYSIN    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=this-data-set(DSLIST)
//         DD  DISP=SHR,DSN-this-data-set(MINIFMT)
//L       EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='MAP,XREF,LIST'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*

Alter the JCL to specify this data set, and run the job.

Use JCL like this to link edit the object code for DSLIST.

//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..DSLIST.LOAD
//LINK    EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='LIST,MAP,XREF'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1)),
//             DSN=*.PREP.SYSLMOD
//SYSLIN DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=this-data-set(OBJECT)

Alter the JCL to specify this data set, and run the job.

CSIDUMP was written to execute IGGCSI00 and dump the data it
returned.

Before you assemble CSIDUMP you almost certainly need to alter one
statement.  Find the statement -

SELECT   DC    CL44'SMYERS.**',CL44'MVSUSER.USERCAT',CL44' '

This statement defines three character strings.  SMYERS.** specifies
the data sets IGGCSI00 is to look for; you can alter its
contents by using PARM='xxx' in the JCL used to run CSIDUMP.
MVSUSER.USERCAT specifies the catalog where the SMYERS data sets
are cataloged.  Do not alter the third character string.

Link edit and run the modified version of CSIDUMP.

CSIDUMP dumps the parameter list it sent to IGGCSI00, the first
64 bytes of the data returned by IGGCSI00, and each catalog entry
returned by IGGCSI00 as a separate entity.  The contents of these
data arereas are described by SC23-6583 DFSMS Managing Catalogs.
The CSIFIELD data area - the first data dumped by CSIDUMP are
also described by the IGGCSINA data area, which is copied from
MACLIB in both DSLIST and CSIDUMP.

DSLIST extracts the search parameter from the EXEC statement PARM
data.  It then extracts the first qualifier from this data, and
uses IGGCSI00 to obtain the related catalog name for the high
level qualifier.

DSLIST then analyzes the search index.  It locates the last index
level in the search index.  If there are no wild card characters
in this index, it appends .** to the search index specified in the
EXEC statement PARM data.

It then invokes IGGCSI00 to locate data sets that match the
search index.  The process to obtain DCB attributes and prepare
the messages is relatively simple, though there is quite a lot of
code for the process.
